<div class="tea-paragraph">
<p class="tea-title">White Teas</p>
<p class="tea-paragraph">White tea is a lightly oxidized tea grown and harvested primarily in China, mostly in the Fujian and province. 
More recently it is grown in Galle (Southern Sri lanka), Taiwan, India, Northern Thailand and Eastern Nepal. White tea comes from the buds and 
leaves of the Chinese Camellia sinensis plant. 
The leaves and buds are allowed to wither in natural sunlight before they are lightly processed to prevent oxidation or further tea processing.</p>

<img src="img/green-tea-large.jpg" alt="White Tea" class="tea-img">
<div class="tea-paragraph">
<p class="tea-title">Green Teas</p>
<p class="tea-paragraph">Green tea is made from the leaves from Camellia sinensis that have undergone minimal oxidation during processing. 
Green tea originated in China, but it has become associated with many cultures throughout Asia. Green tea has recently become relatively widespread 
in the West where black tea has been the traditionally consumed tea. Green tea has become the raw material for extracts used in various beverages, 
health foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetic items. Many varieties of green tea have been created in the countries where it is grown. 
These varieties can differ substantially due to variable growing conditions, horticulture, production processing, and harvesting time.</p></div>

<div id="oolong-content" class="switcher-content">
<img src="img/oolong-tea-large.jpg" alt="White Tea" class="tea-img">
<div class="tea-paragraph">
<p class="tea-title">Oolong Teas</p>
<p class="tea-paragraph">Oolong is a traditional 
Chinese tea (Camellia sinensis) produced through a unique process including withering the plant under the strong sun 
and oxidation before curling and twisting. Most oolong teas, especially those of fine quality, involve unique tea 
plant cultivars that are exclusively used for particular varieties. The degree of oxidation can range from 8 to 85%, 
depending on the variety and production style. Oolong is especially popular with tea connoisseurs of south China and Chinese 
expatriates in Southeast Asia, as is the Fujian preparation process known as the Gongfu tea ceremony.</p></div>

<div id="chai-content" class="switcher-content">
<img src="img/chai-tea-large.jpg" alt="White Tea" class="tea-img">
<div class="tea-paragraph">
<p class="tea-title">Chai Teas</p>
<p class="tea-paragraph">Chai is a flavoured tea beverage made by brewing black tea with a mixture of aromatic 
Indian spices and herbs. Originating in India, the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature 
in many coffee and tea houses. Although traditionally prepared by a decoction of green cardamom pods, 
cinnamon sticks, ground cloves, ground ginger, and black peppercorn together with black tea leaves, retail 
versions include tea bags for infusion, instant powdered mixtures, and concentrates. In many places, there is a 
misconception that "chai" in itself is made with cardamom, ginger, and the other common spices.</p></div>

<div id="herbal-content" class="switcher-content">
<img src="img/herbal-tea-large.jpg" alt="White Tea" class="tea-img">
<div class="tea-paragraph">
<p class="tea-title">Herbal Teas</p>
<p class="tea-paragraph">Herbal tea is any beverage made from the infusion or decoction of herbs, spices, or 
other plant material in hot water, and usually does not contain caffeine. These drinks are distinguished 
from caffeinated true teas (black, green, white, yellow, oolong, etc., which are prepared from the cured 
leaves of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis), as well as from decaffeinated tea, in which the caffeine has 
been removed. In addition to serving as a beverage, many herbal teas are also consumed for their perceived medicinal benefits.</p></div>
</div>

<div id="black-content" class="switcher-content">
<img src="img/black-tea-large.jpg" alt="White Tea" class="tea-img">
<div class="tea-paragraph">
<p class="tea-title">Black Teas</p>
<p class="tea-paragraph">Black tea is a type of tea that is more oxidized than oolong, green and white teas. 
All four types are made from leaves of the shrub (or small tree) Camellia sinensis. Black tea is generally 
stronger in flavor than the less oxidized teas. Two principal varieties of the species are used â€“ the small-leaved 
Chinese variety plant (C. sinensis subsp. sinensis), used for most other types of teas, and the large-leaved Assamese plant 
(C. sinensis subsp. assamica), which was traditionally mainly used for black tea, although in recent years some green 
and white have been produced.</p></div>

<div id="rooibos-content" class="switcher-content">
<img src="img/rooibos-tea-large.jpg" alt="White Tea" class="tea-img">
<div class="tea-paragraph">
<p class="tea-title">Rooibos Teas</p>
<p class="tea-paragraph">Rooibos, meaning "red bush"; scientific name Aspalathus linearis) is a broom-like member 
of the legume family of plants growing in South Africa's fynbos. The generic name comes from the plant Calicotome 
villosa, aspalathos in Greek. This plant has very similar growth and flowers to the Rooibos plant. The specific name 
linearis comes from the plant's linear growing structure and needle-like leaves.</p></div>
