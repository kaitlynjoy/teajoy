<h3>Our Family</h3>

<div class="paragraphs">
<p>TeaJoy started because one big family really loved tea. Elliot and Philomena Jackson, born and raised in England, moved to the US once their land was taken over by the pirates in 1750. They had no professional skills, and no money. But they loved tea, and decided to share that love with the others.</p>
<p>Philomena often says, "Tea is not just for we Englanders, why can't everyone enjoy teatime?" They began the first TeaJoy location in a shed in their backyard in Moorhead, MN. Now TeaJoy has six locations throughout the Midwest, and is expanding</p>

<div class="paragraphs">
<p>Here at TeaJoy, we donate 5% of all profits to <a href="http://www.fmsc.org" target="_blank">Feed My Starving Children</a>, a non-profit organization that packs and sends meals to countries to decrease world hunger. Every cup of TeaJoy you drink helps change the world.</p>
<p>TeaJoy wants to make a difference. We're doing that by giving each of our employees one week of paid vacation time to spend impacting the world and blessing others in any way they choose.</p>
